0,Bruno Lüdke,Germany,1928–1943,51,86,"Mentally disabled, Lüdke was arrested after being discovered with a corpse. Police declared him insane and imprisoned him in a psychiatric hospital, where he died when he was experimented on. The only evidence tying him to the crimes was a confession that may have been physically coerced. He was never given a trial and he is generally[by whom?] considered innocent.[452]"
1,Gerald Stano,United States,1969–1980,22+,41,Confessed to killing 41 women in mostly Florida and New Jersey areas. Some controversy surrounds the case as he is believed by some to have been a serial confessor.[453]
2,"""Highway of Tears"" Killer",Canada,1980–present,18,83,"All the victims were young women and were last seen on Highway 16 in British Columbia between Prince George and Prince Rupert. If they were all victims of the same person, it would be one of the most prolific serial killers in Canada and one with the longest career in the world. Some of the murders have been linked to American criminal Bobby Jack Fowler, although he was in prison at the time others were committed.[454] [455]"
3,Orlando Sabino,Brazil,1966?–1971?,12,,"Suspected of murdering 12 people in Minas Gerais and Goiás, as well as mutilating several animals; sentenced to 38 years imprisonment and died from a heart attack in 2013. There are many theories that he was actually framed by the Military Dictatorship in Brazil, who did the murders for political reasons.[456]"
4,Charles Quansah,Ghana,1993–2001,8,34,"Quansah, who had been in prison for rape twice, was held as a suspect in the deaths of 34 women across the country, including his girlfriend who was strangled in 2000, and eventually confessed to eight murders. He later denied the killings, claiming that the confessions had been extracted under torture, and that the police had also tried unsuccessfully to force him to implicate a number of politicians including former president Jerry Rawlings, his wife Nana Konadu Agyeman and an unidentified member of president John Kufuor's administration.[457][458]"
5,Ottis Toole,United States,1980–1983,7,100–125,"Initially convicted of three counts of murder, later pleading guilty to four more murders before dying in prison. A sometime accomplice of convicted serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, Toole admitted to—and retracted multiple times—over 100 counts of murder, rape, arson and cannibalism, and was the suspect in several other unsolved murders. In 2008, police announced that they had identified Toole as the likely murderer of Adam Walsh, and would be closing the case as a result.[459]"
6,Pedro Rosa da Conceição,Brazil,1904–1911,5,17,"Brazilian mass murderer who killed three people and wounded thirteen others on 22 April 1904.

7,Henry Lee Lucas,United States,1960–1983,3,600+,"Confessed to killing 3,000[460][461] and later 600 people but later recanted and is suspected of lying about a majority of the murders. He originally offered a list of 77 women from 19 different states, but as he confessed to more and more murders, the details became increasingly more bizarre. Some included dismemberment, necrophilia, even cannibalism. Lawmen linked Lucas and Ottis Toole to 81 murders only. Convicted of 11 murders.[462] The true number of murders committed by Lucas is unknown, but it is likely Lucas was not nearly as prolific a serial killer as he initially claimed to be, as most of his murder confessions were thoroughly discredited, and he himself claimed only one murder—that of his mother.[463][464][465]"
8,Wayne Williams,United States,1979–1981,2,24–31,"Believed to have perpetrated the Atlanta murders of 1979–1981.

He was convicted of two murders but confessed to many more, claiming he used a variety of methods from pushing people in front of trains to setting them on fire to poisoning them, and said he had been murdering for a period of some thirty years. In 2015 former detective George Platt published a book about Kelly claiming he could be responsible for 31 murders, prompting the chief of the Metropolitan Police Bernard Hogan Howe to promise a re-investigation into his crimes. However, in 2019 Irish journalist Robert Mullhern published a book raising serious questions about Platt's claims, concluding that Kelly was only responsible for 5 or 6 murders.[467][468]"
10,Allan Grimson,United Kingdom,1986–1998,2,22,"Homosexual Royal Navy sailor Grimson was convicted of the partially sexually-motivated murders of two other (non-homosexual) Royal Navy sailors while docked in Portsmouth on 12 December 1997 and 12 December 1998. Strongly suspected of being responsible for up to 20 other murders across different navy bases of the world, including in Gibraltar and New Zealand.[469] Also the prime suspect in the disappearance of fellow Royal Navy sailor Simon Parkes from Gibraltar in 1986, in part because he disappeared on 12 December, the date when Grimson was known to have always killed his victims on, and because Grimson was docked in Gibraltar with the navy at this time. Grimson's 2001 trial judge told him that he was ""a serial killer in nature if not in number"". His release from prison is imminent and he is currently being held in an open prison with day release provisions.[470]"

Ball killed two barmaids but he shot himself fatally in the chest when police came to question him and was never arrested or interrogated. Yellow press and pulp magazines later exaggerated his exploits, claiming that he had killed up to 20 women and fed them to the alligators, but this was never proven and caused some of Ball's relatives to sue such publications. Police investigated about a dozen women that had worked at Ball's place and were missing at the time of his suicide; some were found alive in San Antonio, but others could not be accounted for.[473]"

Faria's husband Russ was wrongfully convicted of her murder but was exonerated in 2015 and mobile data placed Hupp at the scene of the crime. After Russ was released, Hupp murdered a man named Louis Gumpenberger in 2016 and attempted to frame Russ for hiring him to kill her, but was caught and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder. Hupp is currently awaiting trial for the murder of Betsy Faria, and is also suspected of having murdered her mother Shirley Neumann for inheritance in 2013."

She was released on appeal in 1975, despite three appeal court judges saying there was ample evidence to support the conviction, as the trial judge had inadvertently misled the jury in his final summary.[480] The appeal court judges said that it was an omission that ""a few words could have cured"".[480] Apart from the case prosecuted, another 23 cases were deemed suspicious by investigators.[481] Although acquitted, McTavish's case often is mentioned in lectures at medical colleges in Britain, and is cited in textbooks and academic papers about forensic science and medical malpractice.[482][483][484] McTavish, now known as Jessie Gordon, is believed to have been the inspiration for serial killer nurse Colin Norris.[480]"

There, he was accused of up to 20 of the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez but was convicted of only one, to 30 years in prison, where he died of natural causes in 2006.

He was found not guilty, but then admitted in a press interview to having ""helped"" 300 people to die.

As information on this serial killer was only revealed by a police officer in 2018 during a conversation with a Brazilian writer, and there is no information on his conviction, the confirmation that he was a serial killer is debatable."
